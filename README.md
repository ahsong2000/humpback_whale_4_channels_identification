Siamese Neural Networks:
1. Twin networks (CNN) which accept distinct images and learn the structural feature representation
2. Output of twin networks are joined by an energy function at the top
3. This energy function computes some metrics between twin network's feature representation.
4. Head model 
4. Siamese NNs are popular for finding similarity or a relationship between two comparable images.
